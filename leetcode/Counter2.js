/*
Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.


Test Case :

Case 1 : Input: init = 5, calls = ["increment","reset","decrement"] Output: [6,5,4]
Case 2 : Input: init = 0, calls = ["increment","increment","decrement","reset","reset"] Output: [1,2,1,0,0]
